DAY 1 - 13.01.205
Today I spent searching for inspiration, I had no clue what kind of game
I wanted to make but I have created a moodboard and kind of a mindmap.

DAY 2 - 14.01.205
I spent today finalizing my idea for the game and starting to plan for the structure 
of it. I want to make a game devided into 3 levels where in every level the player has to 
collect a few things and then navigate to a dooor in order to move on to the next level.

DAY 3 - 15.01.205
I started drawing up maps for the levels and started setting up the scripts. Did not go 
very well.

DAY 4 - 16.01.205
I realized the game I want to make is bad, it has no play-value and its overly complicated. 
I need to figure out something more simple with more replay value, I started over, back to
searching for inspiration.

DAY 5 - 17.01.205
I have a new concept and I started planning the structure of it. I want to make a flappy-bird 
type game where the player collects something in order to win. 

WEEKEND
I animated the character set up the HTML. I also set up the basic structure for the 
game-loop as well as a function for switching between game states. 

DAY 6 - 20.01.2025
I implemented the player character I animated and created a gravity and jump function for it. I 
also created functions for resetting and setting up the game as well as starting on the obstacles
& collectables.

DAY 7 - 20.01.2025
I animeted the rest of the gameobjects as well as the background. I implemented these into the 
game and started on the function for spawning them when the game starts.

DAY 8 - 20.01.2025
I finished the function for spawning obstacles and collectables. I also added in collision
detection so the game is failable. The game is now basically working I just have to add some
final touches.

DAY 9 - 20.01.2025
I added some final touches and cleaned up my code. I also implemented a score meter so the player
can see their progress. 

DAY 10 - 20.01.2025
I continued cleaning up the game and styling it as well as solved some minor issues and bugs.
